# <Project Name>

## Purpose

<One sentence describing what this repo/feature is.>

## Start Here

Read `docs/SPEC.md` for the full feature specification.

## Pre-flight Q&A

Read `docs/PREFLIGHT_QA.md` — all questions must be answered before execution begins.

## Chunk Navigation

- `llms-map.json` — machine-readable routing map with chunk definitions and context budgets.
- `docs/chunks/` — one capsule per chunk with acceptance criteria and verification commands.

Execution is wave-based: chunks with no unmet dependencies run in parallel.

## Execution Protocol

1. Compute the next runnable set (all `depends_on` satisfied).
2. Execute all runnable chunks in parallel — for each:
   a. Resolve the minimal context pack from `llms-map.json`.
   b. Read only the resolved files.
   c. Implement the chunk.
   d. Run verification commands.
   e. Confirm acceptance criteria are met.
3. Mark completed chunks in `docs/CHUNKS_DONE.txt`.
4. Advance to the next wave. Repeat until done.

## Verification

```bash
<install_cmd>
<type_check_cmd>
<test_cmd>
<lint_cmd>
```
