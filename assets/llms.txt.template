# <Project Name>

## Purpose

<One sentence describing what this repo/feature is.>

## Start Here

Read `docs/SPEC.md` for the full feature specification.

## Chunk Navigation

- `llms-map.json` — machine-readable routing map with chunk definitions and context budgets.
- `docs/chunks/` — one capsule per chunk with acceptance criteria and verification commands.

Pick a chunk whose dependencies are satisfied, resolve its context pack, implement, and verify.

## Execution Protocol

1. Pick the next executable chunk (all `depends_on` satisfied).
2. Resolve the minimal context pack from `llms-map.json`.
3. Read only the resolved files.
4. Implement the chunk.
5. Run verification commands.
6. Confirm acceptance criteria are met.

## Verification

```bash
<install_cmd>
<type_check_cmd>
<test_cmd>
<lint_cmd>
```
